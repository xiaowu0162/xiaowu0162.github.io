Welcome to my personal homepage.
================================
I am an incoming PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) advised by [Dr. Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). My current research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), especially text generation, low resource learning, and few-shot learning.

I did my undergraduate studies at UCLA, where I researched on image translation under the supervision of [Dr. Aydogan Ozcan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/aydogan-ozcan/) and [Jingxi Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ljxi). In addition, I researched on keyphrase generation with [Dr. Wasi Ahmad](https://wasiahmad.github.io/) and [Dr. Sunipa Dev](https://sunipa.github.io/).
