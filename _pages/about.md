I am a second-year PhD student at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) advised by [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). My current research interests lie in retrieval-augmented language models and text generation evaluation. On the application side, I have worked on keyphrase generation extensively.

I did my undergraduate studies at UCLA, where I researched on image translation and registration for [virtual histology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-021-00674-8) under the supervision of [Prof. Aydogan Ozcan](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/aydogan-ozcan/) and [Dr. Jingxi Li](https://sites.google.com/view/ljxi).
