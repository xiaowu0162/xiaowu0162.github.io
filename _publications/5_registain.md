  Histological examination is a crucial step in an autopsy; however, the traditional histochemical staining of postmortem samples faces multiple challenges, including the inferior staining quality due to autolysis caused by delayed
fixation of cadaver tissue, as well as the resource-intensive nature of chemical staining procedures covering large
tissue areas, which demand substantial labor, cost, and time. These challenges can become more pronounced during
global health crises when the availability of histopathology services is limited, resulting in further delays in tissue
fixation and more severe staining artifacts. Here, we report the first demonstration of virtual staining of autopsy tissue
and show that a trained neural network can rapidly transform autofluorescence images of label-free autopsy tissue
sections into brightfield equivalent images that match hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained versions of the same
samples, eliminating autolysis-induced severe staining artifacts inherent in traditional histochemical staining of
autopsied tissue. Our virtual H&E model was trained using >0.7 TB of image data and a data-efficient collaboration
scheme that integrates the virtual staining network with an image registration network. The trained model effectively
accentuated nuclear, cytoplasmic and extracellular features in new autopsy tissue samples that experienced severe 
autolysis, such as COVID-19 samples never seen before, where the traditional histochemical staining failed to provide
consistent staining quality. This virtual autopsy staining technique can also be extended to necrotic tissue, and can
rapidly and cost-effectively generate artifact-free H&E stains despite severe autolysis and cell death, also reducing
labor, cost and infrastructure requirements associated with the standard histochemical staining.
